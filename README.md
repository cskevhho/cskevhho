ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin (he/him),

I am an ex-personal trainer and manager of over 10 years of experience making a career pivot to software engineering, I am currently an undergraduate student at York University, enrolled in their Computer Science program! Currently I am investing my time in web development, working with front-end technologies like React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, while also delving into the intricacies of back-end development, making strides towards becoming a proficient full-stack developer.

My current focus is on the full completion of the Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum
