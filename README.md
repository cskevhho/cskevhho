ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin (he/him),

I am an ex-personal trainer and manager of **over 10 years of experience** in a professional setting, making a career pivot to software engineering. I am currently an **undergraduate student** at **York University**, enrolled in their **Computer Science** program! Currently I am investing my time in web development, working with front-end technologies like **React**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, while also delving into back-end development with **Node.JS**, and **SQL**, making strides towards becoming a proficient full-stack developer. Thanks to my to my time at York University, I am also well-versed in **OOP** concepts, with **Java** and **Python**!

My current focus is on the full completion of the Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum as a solid foundation to begin my webdev journey.
